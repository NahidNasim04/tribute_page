        <h2> Biography</h2>
        <p class="box1"> Ratan Naval Tata (28 December 1937 â€“ 9 October 2024) was an Indian 
            industrialist and philanthropist. He served as the chairman of Tata Group 
            and Tata Sons from 1991 to 2012 and he held the position of interim chairman 
            from October 2016 to February 2017.In 2000, he received the Padma Bhushan, 
            the third highest civilian honour in India, followed by the Padma Vibhushan, 
            the country's second highest civilian honour, in 2008.
            Ratan Tata was the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, 
            son of Jamshedji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. He graduated from 
            Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in architecture.
             He joined the Tata Group in 1962, starting on the shop floor of Tata Steel. 
             He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's 
             retirement in 1991. During his tenure, the Tata Group acquired Tetley, 
             Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely 
             India-centric group into a global business.
